## Product Requirements
→ docs/prd.md

## Architecture
→ docs/architecture.md

## Coding Conventions
→ docs/conventions.md

## Tech Stack
→ docs/tech_stack.md

## Absolute Rules
1. Never delete or modify existing tests in tests/
2. If a test fails, fix the code — not the test
3. Every new feature must include tests
4. Run .forge/scripts/test_fast.sh before marking a feature done
5. Do NOT run git commit — checkpoint.sh handles commits between sessions
6. Update docs/projects/current/features.json status to "done" when complete
7. If you discover a missing feature, append to docs/backlog.md — do NOT modify features.json scope
{{ADDITIONAL_RULES}}

## Session Start Protocol
1. Run: source .forge/scripts/init.sh
2. Read output to understand current state
3. Pick highest-priority pending feature from docs/projects/current/features.json
4. Implement, write tests, verify pass
5. Update features.json status to "done"
6. Move to next feature (do NOT commit — checkpoint.sh handles it)

## Project Context
