## Tech Stack

## Absolute Rules
1. Never delete or modify existing tests in tests/
2. If a test fails, fix the code — not the test
3. Every new feature must include tests
4. Run .forge/scripts/test_fast.sh before committing
5. Update .forge/projects/current/features.json status to "done" when complete
6. If you discover a missing feature, append to docs/backlog.md — do NOT modify features.json scope

4. Implement, write tests, verify pass
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Update features.json
7. Move to next feature
