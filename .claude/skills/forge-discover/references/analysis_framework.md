# Analysis Framework

## Feasibility Evaluation Rubric

Rate each dimension 1-5:

| Dimension | 1 (Blocker) | 3 (Manageable) | 5 (Strong) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Technical feasibility | Core tech doesn't exist | Exists but complex | Mature, well-documented |
| Market demand | No evidence of need | Some signals | Clear pain point, willingness to pay |
| Competition | Saturated, no differentiation | Crowded but gaps exist | Underserved or blue ocean |
| Timing | Too early or too late | Okay but not ideal | Perfect window |
| Effort vs. impact | Years of work, small market | Months, decent market | Weeks to MVP, large market |

Scoring: 20-25 Strong Go / 15-19 Conditional Go / 10-14 Risky / Below 10 No-Go

## Market Sizing: Bottom-Up Method

1. Define specific target user profile
2. Estimate how many such users exist (industry reports, job listings, community sizes)
3. Estimate adoption rate (1-5% for new products)
4. Multiply by expected revenue per user
5. Result = Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Type | Examples | Mitigation |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Technical | API deprecation, scaling | Prototype early, have fallbacks |
| Market | Low demand | Start narrow, validate with waitlist |
| Competition | Big player enters | Move fast, own a niche |
| Regulatory | Privacy, compliance | Consult early, build in |
| Resource | Takes longer | Scope MVP aggressively |
